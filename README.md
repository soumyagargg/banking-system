# 📚 Simple Bank Management System

A simple command-line Bank Management System built in **C language**.
This project helps you understand basic C programming concepts like **structures**, **arrays**, **functions**, and **menu-driven programs**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📌 **Create a New Account**

  * Add a customer’s name, account number, and opening balance.
* 💰 **Deposit Money**

  * Add money to an existing account.
* 💸 **Withdraw Money**

  * Withdraw money with a balance check to prevent overdrafts.
* 📄 **Display Account Details**

  * View account holder’s name, account number, and current balance.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

The program uses:

* `struct` to store each account’s **Name**, **Account Number**, and **Balance**.
* An **array of structures** to store multiple accounts.
* Functions to perform **create**, **deposit**, **withdraw**, and **display** operations.
* A **menu-driven loop** with `switch-case` to interact with the user.
